# quick lookup place for using nc (net cat)
# on sender
cat {filetosend} | nc -l -p {port} -q {seconds}
# or
cat {filetosend} | netcat {destinationip} {port}

# on receiver
nc {source ip} {source port} > {outputfile}
# or (continued)
nc -l -p {port} -q {timeout} > {destinationfile} < /dev/null

# or there is the man page method

# Sending a Directory of many files
On the receiving end do:
# nc -l -p {port} | tar x

And on the sending end do:
# tar cf - * | nct otherhost {port}
