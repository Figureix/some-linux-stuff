# File/Directory permissions have to be updated for plex to function
(see plex site for info)

I will use either:
mountpoint
findmnt  <-- see https://serverfault.com/questions/50585/whats-the-best-way-to-check-if-a-volume-is-mounted-in-a-bash-script

if [ $(findmnt -rno SOURCE,TARGET "/" >/dev/null;) ]; then
  echo "found"
else
  echo "nope"
fi

echo $? will tell me the return status of ^^^ that, 0 on success, 1 on error.
OR
if [ $(mountpoint -q "location of mount" ]; then
  echo "found"
else
  echo "nope"
fi
