# File/Directory permissions have to be updated for plex to function
(see plex site for info)

# Forced cpufreq to be low

I will use either:
mountpoint
findmnt  <-- see https://serverfault.com/questions/50585/whats-the-best-way-to-check-if-a-volume-is-mounted-in-a-bash-script

if findmnt -rno TARGET "mount directory" >/dev/null; then
  echo "foundmount"
else
  echo "notmounted"
fi
